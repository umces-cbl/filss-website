## Why a website?

::: callout-warning
These are opinions!
:::

Publish or [[perish]{.fragment .highlight-red fragment-index=1}.]{.fragment fragment-index=1}

But what is "publishing"?
:::

## Publishing?

Peer-reviewed manuscripts

::: {.fragment}
*Digital Scholarly Journals are Poorly Preserved: A Study of 7 Million Articles* Eve 2024. Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication.

::: {.callout-warning}
58.38% of works were present in at least one archive. 27.64% were seemingly unpreserved.

Only 0.96% of Crossref members (n = 204) can be confirmed to digitally preserve over 75% of their content in three or more of the archives that we studied.

## Why a website?

-   Communication

    -   more people have phones than computers, especially in underprivileged communities (2020 US Census)

-   Lasting; take it with you when you go

-   Professionalism

    - You are going to be "Googled"

# Setting up a website

## Purchase a domain

-   \$1+ per year (usually \$5-\$20 per year)
    -   [https://www.namecheap.com/](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=myawesomefilsssite)
    -   [https://www.squarespace.com/](https://domains.squarespace.com/?query=myawesomefilsssite)
    -   [https://www.godaddy.com/](https://www.godaddy.com/domainsearch/find?domainToCheck=myawesomefilsssite)

## Domain Name System (DNS)

-   Under the hood, websites are named with gibberish, also known as an IP address ("Internet Protocol")
    -   IPv4: 192.168.1.1
    -   IPv6: 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2
-   DNS translates this to something readable
    -   myawesomefilsssite.com

## DNS Records

## DNS Records

| Type                                                                           | Name             | Content                   |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| [A](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-aaaa-record)       | awesomesite.com  | 123.456.7.8               |
| [AAAA](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-aaaa-record)    | awesomesite.com  | 1234:abc5:1234::abc       |
| [CNAME](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-cname-record/) | subdomain (www)  | wheremysiteishosted       |
| [TXT](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-txt-record/)     | web_verification | Yes, this is actually me! |

## Nameservers

Tell the world what server holds the other records.

| Type                                                                     | Value            |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| [NS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-records/dns-ns-record/) | ns.examplens.com |

-   I use Cloudflare as it has a good bit of protections and services for free.
-   **Including email forwarding!!**
-   Involves changing the nameserver listed with your provider to Cloudflare and verifying

## Verification

-   [Google Sites](https://support.google.com/sites/answer/9068867?hl=en): TXT and (sometimes) CNAME
-   [Canva](https://www.canva.com/help/dns-settings/): A and TXT
-   [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site): A and AAAA
-   [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/support/domains/connect-a-domain-alternative-method/): A and CNAME

# What is a website?

-   A folder with files in it

-   Three challenges:

    -   Creating the stuff that goes in the folders (website development)
    -   Making sure other people can see the stuff (web hosting/content management system)

    ::: {.fragment .strike}
    -   Making sure other people can't mess with the stuff (cyber security)
    :::

## Pick a web hosting service

-   Yourself
    -   Good luck. (Security)
-   Someone else -- "A server somewhere in Arlington"
    -   [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
    -   [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/hosting/)
    -   [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/websites/)

## Pick a web hosting service and design

-   [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/)
-   [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)
-   [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)
